Description: 
You are in a room with a circle of 100 chairs. The chairs are numbered sequentially from 1 to 100.
At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked to leave. This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave will keep going around the circle until there is one person leftâ€¦ the survivor.
Write a program to determine which chair the survivor is sitting in. Please send us the answer and your working code.
